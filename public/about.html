<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

My name is Kishan Roy, and I was born in Bhagalpur district, Bihar. My father's name is Mr. Jayshankar Roy, and he is in the construction business. My mother's name is Shobha Roy. She has had a diverse career, starting as a tailor, then becoming a teacher, and now working as an accountant in a company. Additionally, she manages our home efficiently, earning the affectionate title of "home minister" for her ability to oversee all household matters.

<p>As for me, I completed my 10th and 12th grades in Gujarat under the CBSE board. Currently, I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) at Parul University, and I am in my second year. Over the past year, I have learned several important skills, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), C language, C++ language, HTML, and more. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in the coming years</p>
