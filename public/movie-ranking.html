   <h3> panchayat</h3>
   <p>
       Story: Abhishek Tripathi is back in Phulera after his sudden transfer, while Pradhan Ji and Manju Devi land in trouble for falsely allotting a flat to an old woman under the PM Aawas Yojana scheme. Meanwhile, the rivalry between Pradhan Ji and the local MLA reaches epic proportions.

Review: The third season of 'Panchayat’ remains a riveting and gripping watch, delivering entertainment in abundance. Just when viewers wondered if the makers could pull off another surprise, they certainly do. Despite lacking a central plot, the series compensates with numerous parallel events that keep you invested. This season shifts the spotlight to other characters, sidelining Jitendra Kumar's role, with Bhushan, his wife Kranti Devi, Prahlad, Binod, Chandrakant Singh, the local MLA, taking center stage. The setting and milieu of ‘Panchayat’ still have plenty of charm, and the season ends on a cliffhanger, hinting at another season.

The season begins with a new Secretary arriving in Phulera to replace Abhishek Tripathi (Jitendra Kumar), who was unceremoniously transferred in the previous season. The opposition from Pradhan's side is so intense that the new Secretary is simply unable to complete the joining formalities, and Prahlad's (Faisal Malik) intimidation tactics worsen the situation, ensuring Abhishek Tripathi's return to Phulera. Meanwhile, Pradhan Ji (Raghubir Yadav) and Manju Devi (Neena Gupta) conspire to falsely allot a flat to an old lady under the PM Aawas Yojana scheme. Bhushan (Durgesh Kumar) and Binod (Ashok Pathak), suspecting wrongdoing, investigate the matter. Chandrakishore Singh (Pankaj Jha), the local MLA, is jailed for a dog-killing incident, and upon his release, a truce is arranged between Pradhan Ji and the MLA. However, chaos ensues when a pigeon is killed.

The shift of ‘Panchayat’ to an event-based series is a double-edged sword. While viewers interested in a continuous plot might be disappointed, new viewers can easily catch up without much effort. In the third season, the makers excel in capturing the setting, dialect, and milieu, ensuring plenty of engaging content. The scenes featuring Bhushan and Binod are the highlight of the show, with their chemistry and Binod’s candid manner of speaking being particularly magical. More attention is given to Prahlad’s character, and others like Jagmohan and his mother also share the spotlight. The rivalry between Phulera residents and the local MLA is now out in the open, and the screenplay does a fantastic job of making the scenes very realistic.

Jitendra Kumar has excelled as Abhishek Tripathi, but in the third season, the role feels unidimensional with no new surprises. Neena Gupta and Raghubir Yadav remain central to the storyline. Chandan Roy shines once again as Vikas, and Faisal Malik's expanded role as Prahlad adds to the enjoyment. However, Durgesh Kumar as Bhushan and Ashok Pathak as Binod steal the spotlight once again with their brilliant performances. Full credit goes to the dialogue writers for providing earthy lines to Binod’s character, delivered to perfection.

It was believed that ‘Panchayat’ would conclude after its third season, but the events of this season suggest the makers intend to continue the series. While this is a welcome move and the show remains enjoyable, it's evident that the series has run its course. Without a proper plot, it cannot sustain itself on events alone. However, the characters remain fascinating, and the show's simplicity continues to be a winning element. ‘Panchayat’ is one of those rare shows where the performers outshine the plot, maintaining its appeal even in its third season.

       Time Machine:
   </h3>
   <p> 
       "The Time Machine" is a witless recycling of the H.G. Wells story from 1895, with the absurdity intact but the wonderment missing. It makes use of computer-aided graphics to create a future race of grubby underground beasties, who like the characters in "Battleship Earth" have evolved beyond the need for bathing and fingernail clippers. Since this race--the Morlocks--is allegedly a Darwinian offshoot of humans, and since they are remarkably unattractive, they call into question the theory that over a long period of time a race grows more attractive through natural selection. They are obviously the result of 800,000 years of ugly brides.
       The film stars Guy Pearce as Alexander Hartdegen, a brilliant mathematician who hopes to use Einstein's earliest theories to build a machine to travel through time. He is in love with the beautiful Emma (Sienna Guillory), but on the very night when he proposes marriage, a tragedy happens, and he vows to travel back in time in his new machine and change the course of history.

The machine, which lacks so much as a seat belt, consists of whirling spheres encompassing a Victorian club chair. Convenient brass gauges spin to record the current date. Speed and direction are controlled by a joystick. The time machine has an uncanny ability to move in perfect synchronization with the Earth, so that it always lands in the same geographical spot, despite the fact that in the future large chunks of the moon (or all of it, according to the future race of Eloi) have fallen to the Earth, which should have had some effect on the orbit. Since it would be inconvenient if a time machine materialized miles in the air or deep underground, this is just as well
We will not discuss paradoxes of time travel here, since such discussion makes any time travel movie impossible. Let us discuss instead an unintended journey, which Hartdegen makes to 8,000 centuries in the future, when Homo sapiens has split in two, into the Eloi and Morlocks. The Morlocks evolved underground in the dark ages after the moon's fall, and attack on the surface by popping up through dusty sinkholes. They hunt the Eloi for food. The Eloi are an attractive race of brown-skinned people whose civilization seems modeled on paintings by Rousseau; their life is an idyll of leafy bowers, waterfalls and elegant forest structures, but they are such fatalists about the Morlocks that instead of fighting them off, they all but salt and pepper themselves.
Alexander meets a beautiful Eloi woman named Mara (Samantha Mumba) and her sturdy young brother, befriends them and eventually journeys to the underworld to try to rescue her. This brings him into contact with the Uber-Morlock, a chalk-faced Jeremy Irons, who did not learn his lesson after playing an evil Mage named Profion in "Dungeons & Dragons." In broad outline, this future world matches the one depicted in George Pal's 1960 film "The Time Machine," although its blond, blue-eyed race of Eloi have been transformed into dusky sun people. One nevertheless tends to question romances between people who were born 800,000 years apart and have few conversations on subjects other than not being eaten. Convenient, that when humankind was splitting into two different races, both its branches continued to speak English.
The Morlocks and much of their world have been created by undistinguished animation. The Morlock hunters are supposed to be able to leap great distances with fearsome speed, but the animation turns them into cartoonish characters whose movements defy even the laws of gravity governing bodies in motion. Their movements are not remotely plausible, and it's disconcerting to see that while the Eloi are utterly unable to evade them, Irons, a professor who has scarcely left his laboratory for four years, is able to duck out of the way, bean them with big tree branches, etc.

Pearce, as the hero, makes the mistake of trying to give a good and realistic performance. Irons at least knows what kind of movie he's in, and hams it up accordingly. Pearce seems thoughtful, introspective, quiet, morose. Surely the inventor of a time machine should have a few screws loose, and the glint in his eye should not be from tears.
By the end of the movie, as he stands beside the beautiful Eloi woman and takes her hand, we are thinking, not of their future together, but about how he got from the Morlock caverns to the top of that mountain ridge in time to watch an explosion that takes only a few seconds. A Morlock could cover that distance, but not a mathematician, unless he has discovered worm holes as well.

   <h3> Three iditot: </h3>
   <p> 
       Movie Review: Rest assured, all ye desi cinema buffs, Aal Izz Well in apna Bollywood. If 2009 can begin with Dev D and end with 3 Idiots, it is indeed time to sound the seetis and taalis for one of the most exciting years of contemporary Indian cinema. Truly, this has been the year of the I.d.i.o.t in movielore: the Intrinsically intelligent, Downright smart, Inimitable, Original and Talented film maker, actor, story teller, musician, lyricist, dialogue writer and producer.
       3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by.
       The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.
       So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.
       The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic `humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.
Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as `Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it
